#So until this point the SGB naming scheme has included SGBs that were merged using fastANI, so names like "SGB58-MERGED-SGB72" denoted that SGB58 and SGB72 produced using MASH were collapsed after fastANI was run between representatives. This script just renumbers the SGBs and also make a key between the two labelling schemes. This is mostly for people in the lab who;ve been using these numbers for years now :-)
